/* A thread, in the context of Java, is the path followed when executing a program. All Java programs have at least one thread, 
 * known as the main(parent) thread, which is created by the JVM at the programâ€™s start, when the main() method is invoked with the main
 * thread. In Java, creating a thread is accomplished by implementing an interface and extending a class. Every Java thread is
 * created and controlled by the java.lang.Thread class. When a thread is created, it is assigned a priority. The thread with
 * higher priority is executed first, followed by lower-priority threads.
